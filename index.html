      <h1>Queer Spaces Reimagined: The Resurgence of Lesbian Bars</h1>
      <p class="subhead">How did lesbian bars bounce back after a stark decline? üåàüçπ</p>

    <p>As you stroll down Hudson street in New York City‚Äîthe quaint, tree-lined west village area with a stronghold of LGBTQ+ history‚Äîyou‚Äôll see rainbow flags around at least every other block. Nestled on the intersection of Hudson street and Morton street is Henrietta Hudson, the oldest and one of 32 lesbian bars in the country that not only survived many challenges including COVID-19 but also claims to be on the most visited lGBTQ+ spaces in the city. 
    </p>
 <p>Lesbian-owned businesses, particularly bars, were one of the hardest-hit businesses during the pandemic. Since they already serve a niche market, it was even more difficult for them to have the funds to pay their employees. However, <a href="https://www.lesbianbarproject.com"> ‚ÄúThe Lesbian Bar Project,‚Äù </a> a documentary that examines the remaining lesbian bars in the country, raised nearly $120,000 during the pandemic to help the bar owners keep their businesses running. In addition, the activism that came with the documentary encouraged more queer women to launch their bars.

        <p>‚ÄúI think what some people don‚Äôt understand and I mean‚Ä¶ if you haven‚Äôt been through certain struggles, I can see why that is, but the point is those bars are not just bars where they serve drinks. It takes so much dedication on the owners‚Äô part to run those spaces because of anti-lgbtq legislation as well as disproportionate ways in which COVID-19 affected queer business owners,‚Äù Anne Ortiz, a Cubbyhole patreon.  </p>

        <p>‚ÄúI think lesbian bars have seen a lot  in terms of queer first dates, coming out stories, and I really do appreciate how staff and patrons try to take care of these space as much as they can,‚Äù Ortiz said.

  <p>In the 1980s, there were more than <a href="https://greggormattson.com/2019/12/18/are-gay-bars-closing-some-data/"> 200 lesbian bars </a> in the country. Due to the AIDS crisis, hence a steep decline in the 90s, the number dropped to around 20 in 2020. However, with the 32 lesbian bars post-COVID, those spaces are becoming a bigger market.

  <p>Gregor Mattson, a sociologist and researcher of gender and sexuality at Oberlin College, is committed to debunking the myth that the number of lesbian bar businesses is declining.
  </p>
  <p>‚ÄúPeople, lesbians included are very committed to the narrative of lesbian decline even though the lesbian is alive and well,‚Äù he said.  </p>
  <p>According to Mattson, the other reason for the revival of lesbian bars since COVID-19 is the way those businesses have innovated. In particular, those bars have been open to more identities than lesbians. 
  </p>


  <div class="quote-container">

    
    <p class="quote">‚ÄúNow lesbian bars are open to everybody [and not just LGBTQ+ people]. They have solved this puzzle of ‚Äòhow do you serve one community while being open to everybody?‚Äô‚Äù</p>


    
  </div>

  


  <p>Since lesbian bars have been trying to attract a wider audience, they go by different names such as ‚Äúqueer bars‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs bars‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúlesbian bars,‚Äù Mattson said. This increases the number of bars that can be identified as lesbian but also increases their audience hence the revenue as well as the number of venues where women and non-binary people feel comfortable. 
  </p>
  <p>Despite the growing number of lesbian bars since 2023, those bars still face many challenges as businesses especially compared to gay bars that are larger in number. According to the most recent data, there are over <a href="https://www.lesbianbarproject.com"> 800 gay bars </a> in the country that cater to cis-gendered men. 
  </p>

</script>


  <p>Mattson said that the age gap between gay men and gay women makes it difficult for the latter to start businesses as well as to spend their money in those spaces. 

  </p>
  <p>‚ÄúMen make more money than women do. They have more capital in order to start businesses because starting a business is quite expensive. Culturally, they are more likely to be encouraged to be business owners compared to women so that‚Äôs another cultural barrier to women‚Äôs ownership. And gay women are discriminated against at the level of getting loans or financing,‚Äù he said. </p>
  <p>According to him, the other challenge for lesbian bars to stay in business is the growing LGBTQ equality meaning that queer people feel comfortable socializing outside of queer-designated spaces.
  </p>

  <p>‚ÄúGay bars have lost their monopoly on queer people's leisure dollars,‚Äù he said.
  </p>

  <p>Mattson added that when it comes to the initial decline of lesbian bars that happened in the 90s, said factors cannot be blamed for that decline. Rather, lesbian bars shifted toward including gay men as lesbians and gay men were working more closely during the AIDS crisis.
  </p>

  <p>‚Äú[In the 90s] there's a common pattern where a bar that's a lesbian bar gets adopted by gay men as well and then lesbians who wanted a women's only space will abandon the space and it may well become mostly a gay men's bar,‚Äù Mattson said.

  </p>


  
<p>Mattson added that the 70s and 80s were ‚Äúthe lesbian golden age.‚Äù This was a time when lesbian separatism‚Äîthe idea of creating a women‚Äôs world within the man‚Äôs was the cornerstone of the lesbian philosophy. However, overtime this philosophy declined, and with it went a lot of women-only spaces. 
  </p>

  <p>Another reason why lesbian bars had to become more inclusive earlier than gay men‚Äôs bars is that they had to deal much earlier with the question of trans women and whether trans men were welcome in women‚Äôs spaces. </p>

  <p>In response to the future of lesbian bars, Mattson said that the inclusivity that lesbian bars provide sets an example for all the other LGBTQ+ bars. 
  </p>

  <p>‚ÄúOne thing that surprised me in doing the research was how welcoming lesbian bars were to cis men‚Äù Mattson said. 
  </p>


  <blockquote class="custom-blockquote">
    ‚ÄúLesbian bars are leading the way for all gay bars as a model for how to welcome straight people and everybody and still maintain a mission that supports one part of the community.‚Äù
