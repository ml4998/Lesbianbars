<h1>Lesbian Bars in America: A Data-Driven Exploration</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to illuminate a story often overlooked by mainstream organizations: the resurgence of lesbian bars across the United States and the historical challenges faced by lesbian-owned businesses. Utilizing datasets from the Damron Guide and The Lesbian Bar Project, I crafted visualizations and mapped the current locations of lesbian bars nationwide. This initiative not only charts their prevalence but also delves into the rich history and evolving definition of what constitutes a lesbian bar.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Methodologies</h2>
<p>One significant challenge in this analysis was the ambiguous definition of a "lesbian bar," which varies from bars exclusively for women, specifically for gay women, to those where gay women are predominantly welcomed. This required extensive consultations with experts to refine our counting methodology and ensure accurate representation. Additionally, historical data on queer bars, which often operated clandestinely, was scarce and fragmented. Thanks to rigorous academic research, however, I accessed reliable historical data, allowing for a comprehensive account of lesbian bars. The project also clarifies how it defines a "lesbian bar" to add clarity and enhance credibility.</p>

<h2>Engaging the Community</h2>
<p>Beyond data analysis, this project involved engaging with the community directly. I conducted interviews with patrons at three distinct lesbian bars in New York to capture the reasons behind their patronage and preference for these spaces. These firsthand accounts were complemented by original photographs and interactive scrollytelling elements implemented in JavaScript, enhancing the narrative and visual impact of the findings. This multifaceted approach ensures a vivid, authentic representation of the subject matter, emphasizing the significance and resilience of lesbian bars in America's social landscape.</p>
